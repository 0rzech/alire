Features
========
Ensure that "=" for versions works for any build string
Force explicit arguments in all releases??? (could be ugly? but nicer?)

Fixes/refactorings
==================
Integrate condtrees in Alire (since it's not used in semver)
Rename lock to pin
Separate repository representation (in alire) from checkout (in alr)
    At the same time, unify Repo+Id in single entity at release creation
move Alr.Project to Alire.Project, so user projects depend on Alire only and not Alr

Long term if ever
=================
Use libadalang instead of self-compiling
