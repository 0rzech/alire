Fixes/refactorings
==================

Long term if ever
=================
Force re-fetch
Proper unit testing
Specify main gpr file? Only useful for executables, since libs may have many
Use libadalang instead of self-compiling

Discarded
=========
SAL alire lib? No, because it still requires a list of files to depend on.
Force explicit arguments in all releases??? (could be ugly? but nicer?)
    No, because there are no conflicting types anyway
