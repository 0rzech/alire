Hierarchical tree of version restrictions
Version restrictions in command-line for alr get
Force explicit arguments in all releases??? (could be ugly?)

Rename lock to pin
Separate repository representation (in alire) from checkout (in alr)
    At the same time, unify Repo+Id in single entity at release creation
