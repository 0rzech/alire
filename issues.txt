Project descriptions
"Native" property
OS/Compiler properties

Medium term
===========
Hierarchical tree of version restrictions
Generalized properties for Alire database
Alire.Platform for compiler/OS restrictions
Separate repository representation (in alire) from checkout (in alr)
    At the same time, unify Repo+Id in single entity at release creation
Demo dependencies with expression trees

Long term if ever
