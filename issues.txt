Features
========
Specify main gpr file?
Test framework (report with OS/Compiler, build success for all libs)
Maintainer property

Fixes/refactorings
==================
Separate repository representation (in alire) from checkout (in alr)
    At the same time, unify Repo+Id in single entity at release creation
move Alr.Project to Alire.Project, so user projects depend on Alire only and not Alr

Long term if ever
=================
Use libadalang instead of self-compiling

Discarded
=========
SAL alire lib? No, because it still requires a list of files to depend on.
Force explicit arguments in all releases??? (could be ugly? but nicer?)
    No, because there are no conflicting types anyway
