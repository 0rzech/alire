Features
========
Test framework (report with OS/Compiler, build success for all libs)
Maintainer property? General properties? Named properties?
Force re-fetch
Self-test of native detection

Fixes/refactorings
==================
Check that Alire is not spawning anything anymore, and move to alr
Separate repository representation (in alire) from checkout (in alr)
    At the same time, unify Repo+Id in single entity at release creation

Long term if ever
=================
Specify main gpr file? Only useful for executables, since libs may have many
Use libadalang instead of self-compiling

Discarded
=========
SAL alire lib? No, because it still requires a list of files to depend on.
Force explicit arguments in all releases??? (could be ugly? but nicer?)
    No, because there are no conflicting types anyway
