Features
========
Mercurial
Test framework (report with OS/Compiler, build success for all libs)
Maintainer property? General properties? Named properties?
Force re-fetch
Self-test of native detection
Dependency resolution policies: newest vs oldest (useful for testing?)

Fixes/refactorings
==================

Long term if ever
=================
Proper unit testing
Specify main gpr file? Only useful for executables, since libs may have many
Use libadalang instead of self-compiling

Discarded
=========
SAL alire lib? No, because it still requires a list of files to depend on.
Force explicit arguments in all releases??? (could be ugly? but nicer?)
    No, because there are no conflicting types anyway
