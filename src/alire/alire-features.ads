package Alire.Features with Preelaborate is

   --  "Mirror" of Alr.Commands.*
   --  This hierarchy categorizes the client-facing features, in the sense that
   --  these are "bulk" actions that a user/client app may want to perform.
   --  Right now, most of that functionality is in Alr.Commands.* packages.
   --  Progressively we should migrate it here, making it more self-contained.
