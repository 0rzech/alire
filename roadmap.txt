DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
    Minimal user hassle => Provide a library/app name to build => Alire must contain a map [Name -> Repo]
    Don't force pollution of maintainer code => no extra information/tags for alire
        => Submissions to alire must be merge requests of the relevant information
    Also, alire must be able to understand origins that are uncatalogued (giving the URL/PATH) for developers working on their own libraries, prior to official incorporation
